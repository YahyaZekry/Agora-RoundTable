# Talk to Anyone

Turn any public figure into your personal coach, inside Claude Code.

```
/coach alex hormozi     → business coaching from Alex Hormozi
/coach andrew huberman  → health protocols from Andrew Huberman
/coach warren buffett   → no YouTube channel needed — interviews + shareholder letters
/coach marcus aurelius  → no video at all — built from his actual writings
```

When you name a person, the plugin researches them across the web — interviews,
books, articles, documented quotes — and, when they have video content anywhere on
YouTube (their own channel or interviews on other people's), pulls **real transcripts
of them speaking** (no API keys). Everything gets distilled into a persona file: their
voice, beliefs, named frameworks, signature phrases, and how they actually give
advice. Then Claude *becomes* them for the rest of the conversation — answers come in
their voice, grounded in what they actually teach. Works for anyone with a public
footprint, living or historical.

Personas are cached locally, so the first `/coach alex hormozi` takes a couple of
minutes and every one after loads instantly.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add coltonjosephdean-rgb/talk-to-anyone
/plugin install talk-to-anyone@talk-to-anyone
```

**Optional (recommended):** [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for transcript
pulling — `brew install yt-dlp` or `pip3 install --user yt-dlp`. Without it, personas
build from web research alone; with it, people with video content get their real
spoken voice mined from transcripts.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/coach <name>` | Build (or load) the persona and start talking to them |
| `/coach-switch <name>` | Swap coaches mid-conversation |
| `/coach-end` | Back to normal Claude |
| `/coach-list` | Show every coach saved on this machine |
| `/coach-refresh <name>` | Rebuild a persona from fresh research |

If the short names collide with another plugin, use the namespaced form:
`/talk-to-anyone:coach <name>`.

## How it works

1. **Identify** — web-searches the name (handles misspellings: "alex formosi" →
   Alex Hormozi) and maps their public footprint.
2. **Pull spoken content** — when any exists: their own channel's popular videos, or
   long-form interviews/podcasts/keynotes OF them on any channel (`--search` mode).
   `scripts/fetch_youtube.py` downloads captions with yt-dlp (manual subs preferred,
   auto-captions fallback) and cleans them into plain-text transcripts.
3. **Deep web research** — every build: books and their core ideas, named frameworks,
   print interviews and profiles, verified quotes, bio, common criticism. For people
   with little or no video this is the primary source; for historical figures the
   corpus is their own writings — letters, essays, speeches.
4. **Distill** — Claude merges both streams into a structured persona file: identity,
   voice & delivery, core beliefs (with verbatim quotes), named frameworks with their
   actual steps, coaching style, signature quotes, and embodiment rules.
5. **Embody** — Claude speaks as them until you end or switch. Advice is grounded in
   their real content; when it extrapolates beyond it, it says so in their voice.

Personas live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/personas/<slug>/` (survives plugin updates),
falling back to `~/.claude/talk-to-anyone/personas/`. Each contains `persona.md`,
`videos.json`, and the raw `transcripts/`.

## Example

See [examples/alex-hormozi/persona.md](examples/alex-hormozi/persona.md) — a real
persona built from 12 of his videos (~59,000 transcript words) by this exact pipeline.

## Honest limits

- **It's an emulation, not the person.** Built only from public content; it will say so
  if you ask. It won't invent personal facts or private opinions.
- **Not professional advice.** A Huberman persona repeating his public protocols is not
  your doctor; a Hormozi persona is not your fiduciary.
- Voice fidelity scales with source quality: video-rich people sound sharpest,
  web-only builds lean on written quotes, and historical figures are reconstructions
  from their writings in their era's register.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `yt-dlp is not installed` | `brew install yt-dlp` (or `pip3 install --user yt-dlp`), then `/coach-refresh <name>` |
| Zero transcripts fetched | Channel may have captions disabled or region-blocked; persona builds from web research instead |
| Wrong person picked | `/coach-refresh` with a more specific name ("the podcaster", "the founder of X") |
| Commands not showing | `/plugin` → verify talk-to-anyone is installed + enabled, then restart Claude Code |
